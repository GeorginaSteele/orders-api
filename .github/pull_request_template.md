### Extra notes

## Reviewing this PR

When reviewing this PR, please tag each comment using the COA traffic light system. This system helps us to better communicate during code reviews by more clearly signalling the action required by a comment.

### Traffic lights

游릭 - This comment is a small recommendation/opinion/praise. It does not block the author from merging as the reviewer would still be happy if this comment were not implemented.

游리 - This comment is a request for clarification. The reviewer doesn't understand something and would like to clarify before the PR is merged in.

游댮 - This comment is a required change. The reviewer would not be happy for the author to merge the PR until this comment is implemented.

游댮 This is an example comment on a PR

### Should I "approve", "comment" or "request changes"?

If you have left only 游릭 comments then "approve" the PR. After all, you would be happy for the PR to merge if these comments were not implemented.

If you have left any 游리 or 游댮 comments then "request changes". Something either needs clarification or changing so the PR should not be merged.
