## Design Requirements

- security
- testing
- endpoint documentation (particularly as it will be used by a client)

- would be good to have an abstraction layer on top of db

## Design Decisions

- Using ts-node instead of Docker for speed. If this were going to be used as production code instead of as a POC, I would advocate for Docker
